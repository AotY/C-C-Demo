The preprocessors are the directives , which give instruction to compiler to preprocess the information before actual compilation starts.

All preprocessor directives begin with # , and only white-space
characters may apper before a preprocessor directive on a line.
Preprocessor directive are not C++ statements , so they do not
end in a semicolon(;)

There are number of preprocessor directives supported by C++
like:
	#include
	#define
	#if
	#else
	#line
	etc.
